A Firestore library for your backend.

Currently only used internally.
Just a few methods work, no tests, no docs ;)

In the future we might expand this library to be fully usable and publish it on pub, contributions welcome.

## Usage

A simple usage example:

```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore_server/cloud_firestore_server.dart';

main() {
  var awesome = new Awesome();
}
```
